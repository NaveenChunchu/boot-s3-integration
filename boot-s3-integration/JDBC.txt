Connection:
===========
=>It is used to establish a connection with a specified database. 
=>SQL statements are executed and results are returned within the context of a connection.

Statement:
=========
=>The java.sql.Statement interface is a public abstract interface. 
=>It is the object that is used to execute a static SQL statement and obtain the results of the execution.

Subinterfaces:
-------------
▪CallableStatement
▪PreparedStatement

CallableStatement
==================
=>This interface is intended to support calling database stored procedures. 
=>Thus, the solidDB stored procedures are used in JDBC in the same way as any statement.

PreparedStatement
=================
=>The PreparedStatement interface is a subinterface of Statement. 
=>It is used to execute parameterized query.

Methods:
=>execute(): This returns a boolean value and executes a static SQL statement that is present in the prepared statement object.	
=>executeUpdate():	executes the query. It is used for create, drop, insert, update, delete etc.
=>executeQuery():	executes the select query. It returns an instance of ResultSet.
